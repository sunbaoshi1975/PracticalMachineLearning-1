Question 1
Which of the following are steps in building a machine learning algorithm?

Deciding on an algorithm.
Collecting data to answer the question

Question 2
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

Question 3
What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.

Question 4
What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)?

Predictive value of a positive
Accuracy
Specificity

Question 5
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

9%
